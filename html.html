<!--1. Basics


		1.1 Creating a HTML Document-->
		
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--This tells the browser what language it's in, i.e HTML.-



		1.2 Tags-->

<html></html>

<!--This tag starts the HTML document. Everything within these tags 
will be run. Anything with / in their tag is a closing tag.

Tags always come in pairs, an opening tag and a closing tag. 

Tags nest, and should be closed in the correct order.

Evrerything in between our HTML file will go between the html tags.



		1.3 Head and Body
		
There are two parts to a HTML file. The head and body. -->

<head></head>
<body></body>

<!--The head contains information and the HTML file like the title of 
the window. 


		
		
		1.4 General Use Tag-->
		
<title></title>

<!--Sets the title of the window of your page. This tag must be placed
in the head of the HTML document-->

<p></p>

<!--This is the paragraph tag which contains main body text.-->

<h1></h1>
<h2></h2>

<!--These are heading tags, they format the text in various ways. h1 
has the biggest, boldest font, where h6 has the smallest font yet still
bigger than p. These headers can easily be styled and formatted with 
CSS. -->
